    <h1>Different way to cook potatoes <h1>
    <br>

<h2> Mashed Potatoes<h2>
    <p>prep time 15 min</p>
    <p>cook time 30 min</p>
<h5>Ingredients<h5>
    
<ul>
<li>3 pounds potatoes, russet potatoes cut into large chunks</li>
<li>garlic cloves</li>
<li>½ cup unsalted butter, 1 stick, plus more for serving</li>
<li>1 cup whole milk</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons sea salt, plus more for the cooking water</lili>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>¼ to ½ cup sour cream, optional</li>
<li>Chopped fresh chives, for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h3> Instructions<h3>
<p>1. Place potatoes and garlic in large pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Season water with tablespoon of salt</p>

<p>2. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and gently boil for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes and return to the pot.</p>
<p>3. Begin to mash the potatoes and garlic with a potato masher. When they are partially mashed, add the butter, milk, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency (we like them totally smooth), then use a spatula or wooden spoon to fold in the sour cream, if using</p>
<p>4.Season to taste and serve topped with butter and chives.</p>


<h2>French Fries<h2>

<h5>Ingredients<h5>
<ul>
    <li>4 large potatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 quarts (1.9L)peanut oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions<h3>
<p>1.Place potatoes and vinegar in a saucepan and add 2 quarts (1.9L) water and 2 tablespoons (24g) salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Potatoes should be fully tender, but not falling apart. Drain and spread on a paper towel lined rimmed baking sheet. Allow to dry for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>2.Meanwhile, heat oil in a 6- or 7-quart Dutch oven or large wok over high heat to 400°F (204°C). Add one-third of fries to oil; oil temperature should drop to around 360°F (182°C). Cook for 50 seconds, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, then remove to a second paper towel–lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining potatoes (working in 2 more batches), allowing oil to return to 400°F after each addition. Allow potatoes to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Continue with step 3, or, for best results, freeze potatoes at least overnight or up to 2 months.</p>
<p>3.Return oil to 400°F over high heat. Fry half of potatoes until crisp and light golden brown, about 3 1/2 minutes, adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of around 360°F. Drain in a bowl lined with paper towels and season immediately with kosher salt. Cooked fries can be kept hot and crisp on a wire rack set in a sheet tray in a 200°F (90°C) oven while second batch is cooked. Serve immediately.</p>
