<h2> Mashed Potatoes<h2>
    <p>prep time 15 min</p>
    <p>cook time 30 min</p>
<h5>Ingredients<h5>
    
<ul>
<li>3 pounds potatoes, russet potatoes cut into large chunks</li>
<li>garlic cloves</li>
<li>½ cup unsalted butter, 1 stick, plus more for serving</li>
<li>1 cup whole milk</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons sea salt, plus more for the cooking water</lili>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>¼ to ½ cup sour cream, optional</li>
<li>Chopped fresh chives, for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h3> Instructions<h3>
<p>1. Place potatoes and garlic in large pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Season water with tablespoon of salt</p>

<p>2. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and gently boil for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes and return to the pot.</p>
<p>3. Begin to mash the potatoes and garlic with a potato masher. When they are partially mashed, add the butter, milk, salt, and several grinds of pepper.
